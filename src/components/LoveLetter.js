            Dear Kaitlyn,  
            <br /><br />
            I wanted to give you something a little different for your birthday.  
            A site made just for you â€” because you're one of a kind.  
            Thank you for being the most beautiful part of my life. ðŸ’–  
            <br /><br />
            Love,  
            <br />Nathan
          </p>
        </div>
